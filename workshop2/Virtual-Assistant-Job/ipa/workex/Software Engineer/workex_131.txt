Processor/ARM team 
         Target: achieve ASLIB certification that required the IP must have the ability to detect (self-check) at least 90% error. 
         Job description: 
         Implement Cache Coherent Interconnect (CCI) based on next CCI-IP from ARM (main in-charge ) 
         • Discuss with ARM design team to decide the specification: parameter consideration, how to implement the new CCI, request ARM to support the new feature 
         • Develop the mechanism to detect the fault (self-check function) in CCI without loosing bus performance 
         • Develop the ECC checking scheme for RAM and revise ARM's MBIST path to support MBIST test (MBIST test) the larger RAM size because introducing of ECC scheme 
         • Develop the module to reduce the dynamic power consumption, and RAM leakage power 
         • Design review for MBIST implementation 
         • Build up the random environment based on Cadence eVC and Formal Verification based on IFV to verify the implementation. 
         • Collaboration with DFT and BE 
         engineer to solve the problem of DFT implementation and Layout 
          
         ARM CPU v8 implementation 
         • Develop the mechanism to support the self-check function for ARM v8 core. Target CPU are CA53 + CA57 
         • Revise ARM RTL to adapt Renesas DFT rule and MBIST verification strategy. 
         • Consider and do design review for the new ARM v8 feature such as: support boot ROM AArch32 and AAch64, L2 FLUSH function, reduce RAM leakage power, MBIST implementation for CA53 core. 
         • Enhance the asynchronous bridge between ARM core and CCI to adapt ARM v8 cores
