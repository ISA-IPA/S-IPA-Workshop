Project Handled: 
         Client: MasterCard 
         Environment: Linux, AIX, WAS, JBOSS EAP, JON, WAS ND, Websphere 
         Data Power, webseal , Netscalars 
         Description: Project involves in installing, configuring, monitoring and troubleshooting the problems related to the applications in websphere & Jboss app server environment 
         Key Deliverables: 
         ✦ Experienced in 24x7 production support 
         ✦ Worked as oncall support lead 
         ✦ Instrumental in requirements gathering from clients regarding the application environment creation as per the client request 
         ✦ Verified servers from OS end like file systems and user id/group id creation as per the standards before WAS , Jboss EAP installations 
         ✦ Provided pre-requisites document to the client and OS team as well to complete the OS related tasks 
         ✦ Installed WAS, JBOSS EAP, Apache, IHS, Plug-in and created profiles, nodes and federations on client servers once the prerequisites are done 
         ✦ Submitted an environment request to the client after the WAS installation in which they have to provide the cluster information, JVMs details, JDBC providers, 
         data source, queues, queue connection factories, listener ports, JVM properties, 
         data source properties etc. 
         ✦ Responsible for ear deployments on SIT, UAT, PT, Staging and Production environments 
         ✦ Managed the application until it goes live and need to support for 1 month after it goes live 
         ✦ Provided client support on environments like SIT, UAT, PT etc. which are related to applications 
         ✦ Involved in one touch environment creation 
         ✦ Promptly resolved performance issues in ODR level and Dynamic cluster level
