         ETL Oracle 10g (PL/SQL) , and UNIX Shell Scripting, Tableau, Business Objects. 
         Responsibilities: 
         As Hadoop developer with below functionalities. 
         ⇨ Involved in import and export of 
         data from/to Oracle to/from HDFS using Sqoop. Created Sqoop jobs to populate 
         data present in relational databases to hive tables. 
         ⇨ Involved in creating Hive external tables, loading 
         data, and writing Hive queries using HiveQL with various file formats like Text, Avro, Parquet, Sequence, JSON etc. 
         ⇨ Used Hive to form an abstraction on top of structured 
         data resides in HDFS and Involved in performance tuning of Hive Queries by implementing Dynamic Partitions, buckets in Hive to improve the performance. 
         ⇨ Created RDDs using SPARK with Scala/Python and used various transformation and action and performed in-memory computation capabilities. 
         ⇨ Designed, developed 
         data integration programs in a Hadoop environment with NoSQL 
         data store Hbase for 
         data access and analysis.
