Designed and implemented Dynamic 
         Data Copy Utility to synchronize symmetry/asymmetry 
         databases with no elevated permissions, and eliminated the need to ETL/DBA teams in performing a routine development process. 
         • Designed and implemented complete CI/CD Process for Database Applications, integrated 
         various CI/CD tools such as JIRA, Jenkins, Sonar, Artifactory, Ansible Tower to Streamline the 
         Entire Development Experience. The project also eliminated the need of maintaining multiple 
         vendor tools performing the same operations and saved licensing costs of maintaining them. 
         • Designed and implemented Web Service Mock Utility that calls, saves, and returns stored 
         response based on the request payloads from Mock Server. Automatic creation of different user 
         profiles to support and test different scenarios. It helped to automatically create a user profile by masking and mocking up an error scenario automatically. It helped the team to test and develop the mobile application independently, covering all possible test scenarios, faster 
         development. 
         • Designed, Integrated and Implemented the end-to-end auto Crash Predictor and Simulator by integrating Splunk, Glassbox, JIRA, Bit Bucket, 
         Data Simulator, Path Predictor to Mask and 
         Mock-up the user profile and path of crash, so that an issue can automatically be reported to the developer with an auto setup of simulated 
         data, environment and steps of execution.
