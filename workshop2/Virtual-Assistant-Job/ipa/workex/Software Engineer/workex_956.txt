Project 1 : Network and Users Administration and Software Distribution for 1000+ users.  
           
         Environment: Windows 2000 Server, Windows 2000 Professional, Windows NT Server 4.0, Windows NT Workstation 4.0 and Windows 98/95.  
           
         ALZA is a 
         big pharmaceutical firm with 3 different locations throughout California and more than 1000 users. They are in the process of upgrading from Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 95/98 to Windows 2000 for the servers as well as all the workstations. My job there is to participate in the analysis, design, planning and upgrading process and make sure all the servers are successfully upgraded to Windows 2000. As the old Windows NT 4.0 policies are unable to be used on the new Windows 2000 network, new network policies have to be redefined and implement after the upgrade. Apart from that, I also have to make sure that the integrity of the files still remains and users are able to find their application and 
         data files without much difficulty.  
           
         Another part of my jobs is to make sure all the applications that used to work on the Windows NT 4.0 or Windows 95/98 clients are still able to work on the new Windows 2000 machines and also make use of the new features in Windows 2000 to package and distribute all the applications (nearly 100 or more) that are being used at ALZA Corporation onto any user desktop without any user interference and deploy them in the most efficient manner.
