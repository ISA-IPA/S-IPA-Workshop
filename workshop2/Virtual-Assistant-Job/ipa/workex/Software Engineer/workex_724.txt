Worked with Contact Center Team in developing in-house Issue and Pattern Reporting Tool 
         using MongoDb. This project was to start developing a tool on Sentiment Analysis by reading, 
         parsing and extracting customer's sentiments from their communications via emails, messages, 
         contact center interaction notes etc. and help the organization to improve customer satisfaction.
