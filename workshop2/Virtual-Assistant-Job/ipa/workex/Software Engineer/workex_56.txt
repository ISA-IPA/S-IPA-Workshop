Joined Leo Tech to work on a greenfield sport betting platform written in Groovy utilizing the Spring Boot framework. As one of the first 
         engineers in the London office I played an integral part 
         in building up the teams. 
         ● Development of the sport betting platform, front-end and back-end. 
         ● Designed development/git workflow. 
          
         ● Play the role of scrum master, facilitate scrum ceremonies, embrace and practice agile 
         methodologies. Created a plan of retrospectives which improved chemistry and collaboration. 
         ● Mentor 
         engineers in the tech stack and lean practices. 
         ● As a career coach I had regular meetings with other developers regarding their needs & career objectives, did performance reviews, signed-off timecards. 
         ● Travelled to Singapore to develop a POC of a mobile voice activated app for a bank, written 
         in Ionic2/Angular2. During this 2-month project I wore multiple hats, that of a product owner, 
         scrum master and lead developer.
