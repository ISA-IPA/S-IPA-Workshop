Joined SC to lead development efforts on the API Gateway space for the Foundation Services department of the bank. As a Development Lead I lead 
         engineers to build apps end-to-end, such as a developer portal, a custom CMS, and accompanied tools to assist teams to onboard APIs onto the gateway. Additionally, I set up agile processes, and deal with all matters to take an application to production. Systems developed are based on microservices and deployed on Openshift Kubernetes.
