         ◦ Reactively and proactively drives improvement and ensure no repeated incidents by applying appropriate remedial actions with right preventive measures when necessary. 
         Significant Highlights 
         • On Sep 2014, I took over the QR/ER deployment Lead role. As part of continuous improvements, I have successfully reduced overall server patching time required by at least 30% and simplified patching procedures whilst managing the stakeholder expectations. In addition to this, our team is able to have better work life balance. 
          
         • On June 2016, I was commended by the Unified Communications, Service Delivery manager for reducing the overall Lync server patching hours by 50% with minimized business disruption in the Singapore 
         Data Centre. I have influenced the service partners to group the Lync servers patching into batches for deployment. Early engagement with the on-duty Lync support 
         engineers with defined patching schedule and to agree on the activities to be carried out during the actual deployment. Achieved optimal and successful outcomes with minimized business disruptions in shorter deployment windows. 
          
         • Performed the role of an Application SPOC Coordinator for Asia Pacific region for disaster recovery in addition to my core accountabilities. Established the review process for business application service level which includes application validations through Configuration Management System, identifying key application based on critical/high service level, applications in scope for UAT testing, assessment of key impacts to business. Provided update to date application list to application owner for reviewing, followed by sign off. Successfully communicated to 23 application support teams for application Pre-UAT & Post -UAT during DR exercise. All Application Services were operational after DR exercise through confirmation received from UAT results as well as application owners. 
          
         • Successfully deployed client software deployment via Altiris for client projects. (Secure Foundation - software to reduce malware attack entering BP); online backup (client machine 
         data backup software); Lync 2013 (Microsoft Client Lync version upgrade); 
         Data Encryption (Encrypted client 
         data from copying to external device); Internet Explorer 11 upgrade etc. across 12 countries which cover 7500 machines. 
          
         • Achieved high compliance ratings, above the expected global standard of 95%. The low compliance ratings for client machines that reported during QR/ER/ SR deployment due to 
         big package software (between 150 MB to 2 GB) fail to be installed on client machines in low bandwidth sites. I have took the initiative to use the new analysis tools called "7-steps problem solving methods" to analysis failure reason followed by action in order to achieve the machine compliance target above 95% for client deployment. 
          
         • Recognition and received the sport bonus on the following support /projects for the contributions and initiatives taken: 
         ◦ Year 2016: - Be a winner of June "#IISThanks" globally. Improved and achieved 50% reduction in server patching hours for Lync servers which also results in an improvement in team productivity.
