Goal: to develop a dense 3D reconstruction from multiple views system for Free-Viewpoint-Video TV-broadcast/AR/VR, intelligent surveillance. Use human and objects detection/segmentation/tracking/rendering combined with 2D/3D information to make the system more intelligent. 
         Role: propose new algorithms to reconstruct dense dynamic 3D model/point-cloud/depth-map from multiple views, propose new applications based on 3D, e.g., 3D human pose/action detection/tracking. Leading a 10+ members team. Relative algorithms: camera pose optimization, camera calibration, dense feature/deep-feature extraction, feature matching, optimization algorithm, foreground segmentation, moving object segmentation, rendering, human detection and tracking (2D and 3D), human pose and action recognition(novel 2D and 3D CNN and fusion), deep learning, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), multiple treads and GPU acceleration. 
         Results: The 3D result is much better than the state-of-the-art algorithms. Two patents are filed, one nominated as high quality patent award. A novel deep network with multiple tasks is developed, e.g., object detection/classification/per-pixel-segmentation.
