I joined Citigroup on a contract and was converted to a permanent position within 3 months given 
         my outstanding performance. I was responsible for preparation of annual budgets and revenue 
         forecasting and prepared daily market commentaries for senior management. I was also involved in 
         UAT testing of new system launches and had also developed macros for use in creating regional 
         reports.
