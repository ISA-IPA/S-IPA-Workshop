▪ Performed 
         data preprocessing and 
         data manipulation; built and trained an XGboost model using Python (Sklearn, Pandas, 
         numpy) with the accuracy of more than 90%. 
         ▪ Built advanced house prices prediction using machine learning algorithms followed by dimensionality reduction using 
         Principle component analysis (PCA) which brought the prediction service responsive time to 1/3rd of its original time.
