In this marketing and events company, I was exposed to various industries from FMCG, Technology to Healthcare and Medical. Creation of marketing materials on a daily basis, I've also gained experience of designing materials for an entire campaign - from ideas to full execution on exhibition level. Coordination between clients, ensuring quality control for prints from brochures to exhibition panels, to being physically on site to ensure seamless execution are also required. 
          
         My fluency in Mandarin has also allowed me to work on China based projects - from concept sketches, project development, management completion.
