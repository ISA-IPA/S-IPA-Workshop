Currently I am with a technology start-up, assisting the company • Advertising with their branding and marketing materials. From the initial logo development to building the entire identity of the company, my job scope • Annual Reports also includes - creation of marketing brochures, presentation decks, user manuals and packaging design. I collaborate very closely with my marketing manager to produce content for social media, creation and maintenance of our website as well as regular updates on our blog contents. I also work closely with my software engineers to provide UI/
         UX advice and user flows to ensure our solutions are easy to understand and to use. On a company side project, I have also created a simple and fun app for a local craft beer pub so we can engage customers with an A.I. platform.
